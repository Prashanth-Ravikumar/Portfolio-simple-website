            <p class="section-two__desc">Hello!
                <br> <br>
                I’m Prashanth, a final-year B.E. Electrical and Electronics Engineering student with a strong passion
                for
                full
                stack web development and IoT-based innovations. I’ve built various web applications and embedded system
                projects, combining both software and hardware skills to solve real-world problems.
                <br><br>
                I'm well-versed in the MERN stack, with foundational knowledge in C, C++, and Java, having completed
                certified
                courses from TECMAC Computer Education in 2024. I also completed an online web development internship
                with
                Prodigy InfoTech, where I gained hands-on experience in frontend development and real-time project work.
                <br><br>
                A quick and hands-on learner, I’ve actively participated and won in inter-college hackathons and
                technical
                symposiums. I take pride in my leadership qualities and collaborative mindset. Outside academics, I’m a
                passionate singer, which fuels my creativity in both tech and life.

                    <h1>Udemy Clone</h1>
                </li>
                <p>
                    Built a responsive Udemy-style frontend interface for an online learning platform using HTML,
                    Tailwind
                    CSS,
                    and vanilla JavaScript. The project replicates key UI components of Udemy, including course
                    listings,
                    category filters, navigation bar, course detail pages, and responsive layouts. Tailwind CSS was used
                    to
                    design a clean, modern interface with utility-first styling, ensuring consistent design and mobile
                    responsiveness. JavaScript added interactivity such as dynamic course cards, modal pop-ups, and user
                    navigation. This project showcases frontend design and UI/UX skills, closely simulating a real-world
                    educational web application.

                </li>
                <p>
                    Developed an interactive and responsive website for a college symposium to showcase event details,
                    schedules, and registration forms. Designed with an engaging UI using HTML and CSS, and added
                    interactivity
                    using JavaScript to enhance user experience. The website served as the central platform for
                    participant
                    engagement and event promotion.

                <li>
                    <h1>Smart Energy Management System</h1>
                </li>
                <p>
                    Developed a Smart Energy Management System that integrates the PZEM-004T energy meter with an ESP32
                    microcontroller to monitor and control energy consumption in real-time. The system provides detailed
                    energy
                    usage data, including voltage, current, and power, which is sent to a cloud database built using the
                    MERN
                    stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The web-based dashboard allows users to track their energy
                    usage,
                    set consumption limits, and receive alerts when thresholds are exceeded, promoting efficient energy
                    use
                    and
                    cost savings. The system is scalable, offering potential for integration with smart home devices and
                    further
                    automation features.
                </p>


                <li>
                    <h1>Smart Home Automation</h1>
                </li>
                <p>
                    Developed a smart home automation system using the ESP32 microcontroller integrated with the Blynk
                    mobile
                    app. Enabled wireless control of home appliances (lights, fans, etc.) through relays. The system
                    provides
                    real-time monitoring and remote switching via Wi-Fi, enhancing convenience, energy efficiency, and
                    safety in
                    a modern smart home environment.
                </p>

                <li>
                    <h1>Automatic Hand Sanitizer Dispenser</h1>
                </li>
                <p>
                    Designed a contactless automatic hand sanitizer dispenser using an Arduino UNO, ultrasonic sensor,
                    relay
                    module, and mini water pump to promote hygiene in public spaces. The sensor detects hand proximity
                    and
                    signals the Arduino to activate the pump via a relay, dispensing sanitizer without physical contact.
                    This
                    low-cost, efficient system is ideal for schools, hospitals, and offices, especially during
                    health-sensitive
                    times, with potential for future IoT-based enhancements.
